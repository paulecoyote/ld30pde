{"name":"Ld30pde","tagline":"Ludum Dare 30 Attempt","body":"### Ludum Dare 30 Attempt\r\n## Theme \"Connected Worlds\"\r\nTo be honest the theme has stumped me a little bit. I'm going to work from this dictionary meaning:\r\n> a part or aspect of human life or of the natural features of the earth, in particular.\r\n\r\nSo human life and natural features.\r\nThe ideas I have had so far are quite... flowery.  Even my first thing to do was get a flower on the screen.\r\n\r\n## Technology: Google Dart\r\nWell I work in it all the time, heck even doing client side stuff right now.  Seemed sensible.  Thought I would kick its tyres a bit without work's code library.\r\nAlso git.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n* [Ludum Dare 30](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/08/20/welcome-to-ludum-dare-30/)\r\n* [Google Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/)\r\n* [Colour Scheme Created via paletton.com](http://paletton.com/#uid=30G0u1kd+uc3nNl7DEjkdoYpskZkb6Bu1-+768QMgqrrmhirkfUvv4aXDadKMk+oEq+fh)\r\n\r\n## Diary\r\n23rd Aug 14 3:41AM Austin, Tx\r\nRocky start... I was trying to use Chrome Dev Editor and already missing things like autocomplete and going to definition for stuff in packages.  Spent ages just getting a blank canvas sizing properly, then defining colours and a safe area, the drawing a single flower.\r\n\r\nSo for the moment I am still in. I am going to see if I can get a latest version hosted on the site and sleep on it.\r\nIf I make good progress for the rest of Saturday I'll stay in... if I do not have something playable and a little entertaining at some point on Saturday I will bail and just enjoy Sunday.","google":"UA-53984713-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
